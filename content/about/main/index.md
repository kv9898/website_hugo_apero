  I belive that monetary policy is the most important part of sovereignty for nation states in the 21st century, to the extent that it should no longer be considered a purely "economic" subject, but an inherent political topic. At the end of the day, money printing, despite some limits, is like a cheat code of the game, right? Sadly, central banks and governments are, one could say, very bad at using this power. In this regard, I agree with the Modern Monetary Thoery (MMT) on the underutilisation of monetary policy (although I do not agree with their stance on fiscal policy as a feasible tool to tackle inflation). I (crazily) think central banks should be operating in the *stock market*, for profit, both as a monetary tool and as a fiscal tool to tax the rich. The investments can serve as a sovereign wealth fund which benefits all citizens. Sounds like socialism? I think that's the right way forward. More importantly, I think the public should be better informed about monetary policy as an additional check on the central banks, in the era of central bank independence (CBI).

  I used to be a Marxist. However, I later distanced myself from from the ideology for its inherent totalitarian tendencies, as Popper points out. Moreover, I do not think a proletarian revolution that overthrows will eventually happen. In my understanding of the dialectical process, a *new* class, not existing classes under the capitalist system (bourgeoisie or proletariat) will send capitalism to its grave. For me, it seems that the new class is the *technocrats* equipped with the new data science techniques. I think, at the end of the day, data will replace capital as the main means/factor of production. An AGI revolution for the new stage (socialism?) will echo the industrial revolution for capitalism. Will it bring a better life? Not necessarily. While I think an AI revolution will improve the *material* aspects of standards of living, it leads us to question the purpose of our lives. Greek teleology, huh? I think many people will commit suicide for losing their "purpose of life", only those who are happy to "lie flat" (躺平) can survive. I'm striving to become the latter :)
