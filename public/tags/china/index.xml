      <description>Abstract The relationship between China and the Philippines has seen dramatic fluctuations in recent years, with the South China Sea dispute becoming increasingly prominent in bilateral relations. Grounded in the theoretical debate between realist-liberal International Relations (IR) theorists, this study seeks to empirically measure the economic impact of the South China Sea dispute between China and the Philippines from 2012 to 2016. To do so, we use the Dynamic Multilevel Latent Factor Model (DM-LFM) and monthly trade data between the two countries to quantitatively assess the impact of the dispute on bilateral trade.</description>
