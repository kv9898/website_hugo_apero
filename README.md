# This version is OBSOLETE. My [new website](https://rubuky.com) is built with Quarto.
Hi there, welcome to the github page for my previous personal website. [Here](https://github.com/kv9898/website) is a link to my Quarto-based new website's repo. The website based on this repository was built on the [Hugo Ap√©ro](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) template, and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I first came across these tools at Julia Silge's ([@juliasilge](https://github.com/juliasilge)) [website](https://juliasilge.com/) and was immediately drawn to the appearance. Moreover, this template is R-based, which is suitable for me as an R user. In line with my predecessors, this website is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) so feel free to reuse my and my predecessors' codes!
